			<p>PHINMA Cagayan de Oro College was established back in 1948 as Parent-Teacher College - a nonpolitical and nonsectarian educational institution. The school served the youth and working individuals by providing education from the primary to the tertiary levels. In the next 30 years, PHINMA COC expanded its course offerings to include Computer Science, Engineering, and Mass Communications.</p>
			<p>PHINMA COC was acquired in 2005 by PHINMA, making it one of the conglomerate’s first investments in the educational sector. Through PHINMA’s leadership and management, the college improved its existing academic programs by employing non-traditional approaches to learning.</p>
			<p>As part of PHINMA, PHINMA COC was able to make quality education accessible to students from all walks of life in Mindanao. PHINMA also helped provide a conducive learning environment that inspired them to persevere in their education even more.</p>
			<p>The College was able to grow its business and open its second campus in Puerto in 2012, where PHINMA further realized their goal of providing better quality yet affordable education to more Filipinos. Today, graduates from PHINMA COC continue perform excellently in various board exams, as they have done before.</p>
