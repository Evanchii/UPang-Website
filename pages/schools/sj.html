			<hr/>
			<p>PHINMA Saint Jude College is a tertiary educational institution in Sampaloc, Manila. Its students are the most hardworking and resilient lot you'll ever see, striving to do their best in their academics - and even working to earn - so that they may take on tomorrow and build better lives for themselves.</p>
			<p>The college started out as St. Jude Maternity Clinic in 1950. Through the efforts of its owners, Dr. Ramon Atienza and Dr. Felicidad Calip-Atienza, the clinic grew to become a 120-bed hospital. It was then when the School of Nursing was born. Soon, the college established its name in the medical sciences, particularly nursing. PHINMA SJC has been producing board top-notchers since 1971.</p>
			<p>PHINMA Saint Jude College is one of the seven member schools under the PHINMA Education system. It was acquired in 2017 as part of PHINMA’s thrust to provide better quality yet affordable education to improve the lives of more Filipinos. PHINMA Education’s goal is to strengthen the College’s academic programs and diversify our course offerings to give more students the chance to take on challenges and build a better tomorrow for themselves and their families.</p>
